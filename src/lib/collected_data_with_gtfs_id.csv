 There were only a few people on the platform at first. But when I reached the turnstiles, it was packed — lots of people waiting to catch the 1 or R train. Most of them were coming from the Staten Island Ferry. There was a long line of us trying to pay the fare, and I was one of them.
 

 It started getting hot, especially when the train didn’t come right away. Sometimes it’s delayed, but today it was mostly on time. At the South Ferry station, there’s some cool air blowing from the top of the station, but it’s not strong enough to cool the whole place down. When the train arrives on schedule, the crowd clears out a bit. But if it's late, the heat and crowd build up fast — it gets really uncomfortable.","93,9",48.8,142
